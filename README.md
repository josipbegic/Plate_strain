# Plate_strain
Mathematical model of uniform strain on homogenous plate with hole in the middle. For running the program, C++ library DUNE is needed, and viewing .pvsm data should be done in program ParaView. Data should be opened with Load state function, and using vectors u1 and u2 in Calculator with operation  u1*iHat+u2*jHat.
